## üöÄ Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Required Tools:

Download and install Docker, Maven, and JDK Development Kit.

### 2. Clone the Project Repository:

Clone the project repository using Git.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables:

In the `.env` file, provide the necessary environment variables related to the database and Docker. Below is an example configuration:

| Variable Name         | Value |
|-----------------------|-------|
| MYSQLDB_DATABASE      | jobs  |
| MYSQLDB_USER          | admin |
| MYSQLDB_PASSWORD      | root  |
| MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | root  |
| MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT    | 3307  |
| MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT   | 3306  |
| SPRING_LOCAL_PORT     | 8081  |
| SPRING_DOCKER_PORT    | 8080  |
| DEBUG_PORT            | 5005  |

### 4. Build the Application:
Run the command mvn clean package to build the application.

### 5. Run the Docker Container:
Execute the command docker-compose build to build the Docker container.

Then, use docker-compose up to start the Docker container.

### 6. Accessing the Application:
The application will be available locally at: http://localhost:8081/api.

You can test the application using tools such as Postman or Swagger. For Postman, remember to pass the authentication (Bearer Token) received after logging in.

### 7. Testing Admin and Standard User Features:
- **To test admin features, use the following login credentials:**

Email: admin@example.com,
Password: 123123123

- **For testing standard user features, follow these steps:**

Register a New User:

- **Endpoint: POST /register**
  Request Body: Provide details for email, first name, last name, and password.
  Log In:

- **Endpoint: POST /login**
  Request Body: Use the email and password from the registration step.
  Obtain Bearer Token:

After logging in, you will receive a JWT Bearer token.
Access Standard User Features:

Include the Bearer token in the Authorization header of your requests to access standard user features.
